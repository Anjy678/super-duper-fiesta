Your teammates walked all the way to college from memorial but it wasn't too big of a deal even though they walked all over the 3rd floor of memorial lol it was a nice excersise. 

There was a man in the distant horizon riding a horse. He appeared to be waiting for something, or rather someone. The setting sun made it hard to pnpoint any fine details on him as all one could see as a tall, dark silhouette.
